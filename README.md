#RobotShop
---
*By: Infinite Monkeys Studio*

###Game Play:
---
You are the owner of a shop that designs, manufactures and sells robots.  You start with nothing, but your hands and a shop. Then through randomly generated contracts you earn money and supplys. To fill the contracts you must design and construct robots. Contracts will slowly get more demanding with higher quantities and tighter deadlines. You will need to hire some employees. Humans are imperfect and inefficient. When you become wealthy enough you will be able to build robots to help you in the shop. Once you construct a robot with AI you will have to write your own AI.

###Nuts & Bolts
---
We are working in Java with the render and control libraries from processing. We will phase out any involvement with processing before releasing.

We like to encourage modding. To that end we will be providing Java docs as soon as it becomes relevant.

###Plan for release
---
Our plan is to release a free alpha as soon as we can.
